****Trial 1****
accuracy = 4.570%
time: 1hr 25mn 54s

added back assingItemMemory function to better compare to python/matlab applications;
seemed to make little to no change;

compared with matlab findings to see if cosAngle function was working properly;
the two appeared very similar as if working the same(they would never be equal since it HVs are random each time);

going to print the resulting vector from matlab from training and a testing file and apply those into test() manually to see if it returns right answer;
